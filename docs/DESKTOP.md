# Optional desktop display

The SDL3 frontend displays both original LCD images in one resizable window. The main screen keeps its proportions; the whole touchscreen appears at bottom right at approximately 28% of window width. Tab enlarges/restores it, F11 toggles fullscreen, and mouse clicks map to the original 320x240 touch coordinates.

## Current verification scope

The latest batch starts from `c656402` and adds three missing startup sections. Each new headless build passed 84/84 enabled tests, and each fresh headless game run passed its previous stopping point. The final stop is MissingBlock `0x00152DCC`, 957 executed core-0 instructions beyond the saved same-mode baseline. Captured audio, state and save contents match that baseline.

No fresh original-game desktop run or screenshot was taken in this batch. The earlier loading image remains the last verified visible result. These headless results do not establish a visual change, usable menus, gameplay, speaker playback or Windows compatibility.

The next reviewed interval is `[0x00152DCC, 0x00152EB4)`, 58 instruction words, using already supported operations. See [the checkpoint](../CHECKPOINT.md) and [current recovery record](recovery/CURRENT-REBUILD.md) for the exact continuation. Executables, generated game code and runtime evidence remain private.

## Build

Desktop support defaults to off. The headless build does not require SDL. With the public source in `repo`, restored private AOT in `restored-aot/generated2`, and authenticated private inputs:

```bash
cmake -S repo -B build-desktop -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release   -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DLEGO_BUILD_DESKTOP=ON   -DLEGO_AOT_DIR="$PWD/restored-aot/generated2"   -DLEGO_SUPPLEMENT_CODE_BIN="$PWD/recovered-inputs/LEGO-Chase-Recovery/code.bin"
cmake --build build-desktop --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build-desktop --output-on-failure
```

Use a C++20 toolchain, CMake, Ninja, Python 3, Clang and llvm-objdump. CMake looks for installed SDL3 3.2 or newer; otherwise `LEGO_FETCH_SDL3=ON` fetches the pinned SDL 3.4.18 archive. For an existing installation, pass `-DSDL3_DIR=/path/to/lib/cmake/SDL3 -DLEGO_FETCH_SDL3=OFF`. Linux window support also needs the system development libraries for its selected backend.

## Run and controls

Use `--frontend sdl` to enable the window and input producer. It requires `--cpu-mode diagnostic-dual`, `--display-clock-mode reference-idle` and `--gpu-vram-mode reference-zero`. Omitting the frontend option retains headless execution. Reuse the authenticated input and diagnostic profile described in the private continuation, but create fresh owned state/save and output paths for each run.

Optional `--desktop-screenshot <new-path.bmp>` saves the actual first nonblack SDL render target and refuses an existing output. It writes no screenshot if no such frame is reached and never inserts a game image.

| PC control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left mouse inside lower panel | Touchscreen press |
| Tab | Enlarge/collapse lower panel |
| F11 | Toggle fullscreen |
| Escape / close window | Stop desktop run |
| Z / X / S / A | 3DS A / B / X / Y |
| Q / W | 3DS L / R |
| Enter / Backspace | Start / Select |
| Arrow keys | D-pad |
| I / J / K / L | Circle pad up / left / down / right |

Short presses and clicks remain pending until the next committed HID sample. Focus loss releases input; leaving the panel or changing layout cancels touch input. Minimizing defers presentation and releases input while retaining the latest frame for restore.

## Remaining limits

Scanout supports verified rotated RGB8 buffers in device VRAM and explicit LCD force-black. Unsupported formats, fills, selectors and bounds stop explicitly. Input is published at modeled display periods, not verified hardware speed. Audio is captured to the DSP file; this frontend does not implement speaker playback. Windows desktop execution is untested, and the SaveData/SharedExtData backend is not implemented for Windows. No game-specific minimap crop is enabled.

Keep original inputs, generated game code, executables, screenshots, audio and saves private. Hosted synthetic desktop checks are not original-game visual evidence.
