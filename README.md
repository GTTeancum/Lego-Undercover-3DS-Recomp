# LEGO City Undercover: The Chase Begins — 3DS Recomp

Recovery repository for an AI-assisted native recompilation effort targeting **LEGO City Undercover: The Chase Begins** (Nintendo 3DS).

## Recovery state

The original local working tree was lost. This repository is being rebuilt from surviving project artifacts and checkpoints. The latest documented baseline is **Recovery J**, followed by the additive **Focus K01** diagnostic work.

Documented Recovery J state included:
- 604 generated AOT translation files.
- Native runtime, 3DS service support, renderer, audio, desktop/input integration and tests.
- Native Linux execution reaching interactive Cherry Tree Hills.
- 296/296 initializers completed.
- Save/exit/reload coverage in-process.
- Known unresolved first-load real-time intro rendering defect.
- Focus K01 narrowed the invalid shadow projection data flow.

## Repository layout

- `docs/recovery/` — recovered checkpoint/status documentation and provenance.
- `src/generated/` — recovered/generated AOT game-code translation pages.
- `src/runtime/` — native runtime and memory/kernel implementation.
- `src/services/` — 3DS service implementations.
- `src/renderer/` — graphics translation/presentation.
- `src/audio/` — audio implementation.
- `src/frontend/` — desktop/input/window integration.
- `tests/` — native and Python regression tests.
- `tools/` — preparation, translation, extraction and diagnostic tools.
- `diagnostics/` — focused diagnostic fixtures such as Focus K01.
- `reports/` — reproducibility/results material safe to publish.
- `game/` — local user-supplied game data; intentionally ignored by Git.

## Game data

No copyrighted game image, RomFS, extracted assets, `code.bin`, saves, or captured game audio should be committed. Users must supply their own legally obtained game data locally.

## Current goal

Recover the latest surviving source package as faithfully as possible before resuming development. Do not regenerate or replace recovered files when an original surviving copy can be located.
